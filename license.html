This JSOFA software is derived from the International Astronomical
Union's (IAU) &quot;Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy&quot; (SOFA) library -
official C release. The intention is to reproduce the functionality and
algorithms of the IAU SOFA library in a pure Java form.

The responsibility for the maintenance and supply of the JSOFA library
lies with the author (not the IAU SOFA Board).  However, The JSOFA
software is provided &quot;as is&quot; and the author makes no warranty as to
its use or performance.  The author does not and cannot warrant the
performance or results which the user may obtain by using the JSOFA
software.  The author makes no warranties, express or implied, as to
non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or fitness
for any particular purpose. In no event will the author be liable to
the user for any consequential,  incidental, or special damages,
including any lost profits or lost savings, even if the author has
been advised of such damages, or for any claim by any third party.

Other conditions of the original license (reproduced below) are
carried over as applicable.

  Copyright (C) 2018
  Standards Of Fundamental Astronomy Board
  of the International Astronomical Union.

  =====================
  SOFA Software License
  =====================

  NOTICE TO USER:

  BY USING THIS SOFTWARE YOU ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING SIX TERMS AND
  CONDITIONS WHICH APPLY TO ITS USE.

  1. The Software is owned by the IAU SOFA Board (&quot;SOFA&quot;).

  2. Permission is granted to anyone to use the SOFA software for any
     purpose, including commercial applications, free of charge and
     without payment of royalties, subject to the conditions and
     restrictions listed below.

  3. You (the user) may copy and distribute SOFA source code to others,
     and use and adapt its code and algorithms in your own software,
     on a world-wide, royalty-free basis.  That portion of your
     distribution that does not consist of intact and unchanged copies
     of SOFA source code files is a &quot;derived work&quot; that must comply
     with the following requirements:

     a) Your work shall be marked or carry a statement that it
        (i) uses routines and computations derived by you from
        software provided by SOFA under license to you; and
        (ii) does not itself constitute software provided by and/or
        endorsed by SOFA.

     b) The source code of your derived work must contain descriptions
        of how the derived work is based upon, contains and/or differs
        from the original SOFA software.

     c) The names of all routines in your derived work shall not
        include the prefix &quot;iau&quot; or &quot;sofa&quot; or trivial modifications
        thereof such as changes of case.

     d) The origin of the SOFA components of your derived work must
        not be misrepresented;  you must not claim that you wrote the
        original software, nor file a patent application for SOFA
        software or algorithms embedded in the SOFA software.

     e) These requirements must be reproduced intact in any source
        distribution and shall apply to anyone to whom you have
        granted a further right to modify the source code of your
        derived work.

     Note that, as originally distributed, the SOFA software is
     intended to be a definitive implementation of the IAU standards,
     and consequently third-party modifications are discouraged.  All
     variations, no matter how minor, must be explicitly marked as
     such, as explained above.

  4. You shall not cause the SOFA software to be brought into
     disrepute, either by misuse, or use for inappropriate tasks, or
     by inappropriate modification.

  5. The SOFA software is provided &quot;as is&quot; and SOFA makes no warranty
     as to its use or performance.   SOFA does not and cannot warrant
     the performance or results which the user may obtain by using the
     SOFA software.  SOFA makes no warranties, express or implied, as
     to non-infringement of third party rights, merchantability, or
     fitness for any particular purpose.  In no event will SOFA be
     liable to the user for any consequential, incidental, or special
     damages, including any lost profits or lost savings, even if a
     SOFA representative has been advised of such damages, or for any
     claim by any third party.

  6. The provision of any version of the SOFA software under the terms
     and conditions specified herein does not imply that future
     versions will also be made available under the same terms and
     conditions.

  In any published work or commercial product which uses the SOFA
  software directly, acknowledgement (see www.iausofa.org) is
  appreciated.
